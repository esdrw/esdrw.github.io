          <p>
            Hello there! Thanks for stopping by. As an introductory post, I'd like to explain what I'm trying to do here.</p>
          <p>
            This blog is for me to use as an outlet for knowledge and ideas. It'll be my personal space to explore topics of interest and organize what I discover from my explorations. I intend to post primarily technical content, and perhaps the occasional piece of advice or analysis of current events. This is where I will direct anyone who asks, who are you and what do you know? However, this blog is not really going to be about me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to focus primarily on having interesting and informative content for any readers who meander by. Even though there is a vast amount of information available at our fingertips, building up knowledge is a difficult task. I'd like to write down what I learn in a way that will make it just a bit easier for someone else to learn it as well. I'll do my best to continuously improve the quality of my posts, so please excuse any amateurish writing, and feel free to point out mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            E. Wang
