Hello there! Thanks for stopping by. As an introductory post, I'd like to explain what I'm trying to do here.

This blog is for me to use as an outlet, and a personal space to explore topics of interest to me and to organize what I discover. As a result, posts might be about pretty much anything. This is where I will direct anyone who asks, who are you and what do you know?

Since I'm taking the time to maintain this blog, it should come as no surprise that my second objective is to share what I know. Even though there is a vast amount of information available at our fingertips, building up knowledge is a difficult task. I'd like to write down what I learn in a way that will make it just a bit easier for someone else to learn it as well. I'll do my best to continuously improve the quality of my posts, so please excuse any amateurish writing, and feel free to point out mistakes.

E. Wang
