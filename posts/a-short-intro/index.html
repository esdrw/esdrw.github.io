            Hello there! I wasn't sure whether to have any introductory post at all. But then I thought about it more, and I realized that even if it might seem a little unnecessary to me (information and content are what matter!), having a bit of my personal voice will make this blog a more engaging read. So, welcome! Let me start by explaining who and what this blog is for.
          </p>

          <p>
            This blog is for me because writing posts will force me to better research and articulate my ideas. I intend to post primarily technical content, and perhaps the occasional bit of career advice or analysis of current events. This blog will be my place to keep my writing, and I'll be able to use it as a starting point when someone asks, who are you and what do you know? Plus, I'll get to produce something concrete with the time I spend on my hobbies.
          </p>

          <p>
            This blog is for you because I would be delighted if you were to learn something or think of a new idea in exchange for your time spent reading this blog. I hope to make it easier to be an independent seeker of knowledge. I will do my best to continuously improve the quality of my content, so please excuse any amateurish writing, and feel free to point out mistakes!
          </p>
          <p>
            Happy reading, <br>
            E. Wang
