            Hello there! I wasn't sure whether to have any introductory post at all. Information and content matter most, after all. But then I thought that even if it seems a little unnecessary to me, perhaps having a bit of my personal voice will make this blog a more engaging read. So, welcome! Let me start by explaining who and what this blog is for.
          </p>
          <p>
            This blog is for me because writing posts will force me to better research and articulate my ideas. I intend to post primarily technical content, and perhaps the occasional bit of career advice or analysis of current events. This blog is where I will keep all my writing, and where I will direct anyone who asks, who are you and what do you know? Plus, I'll get to produce something concrete with the time I spend on my hobbies.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, this blog is for you as well. I would be delighted if you were to learn something or think of a new idea in exchange for your time spent here. I hope I can make it easier to be an independent seeker of knowledge. I will do my best to continuously improve the quality of my content, so please excuse any amateurish writing, and feel free to point out mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Happy reading, <br>
            E. Wang
